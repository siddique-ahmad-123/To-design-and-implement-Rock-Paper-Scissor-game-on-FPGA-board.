# To-design-and-implement-Rock-Paper-Scissor-game-on-FPGA-board.
The "Rock Paper Scissors" project implements a decision-making game on an FPGA using Verilog. Players input choices via switches, and the system processes them in real-time to determine the winner. Results are displayed using LEDs or a seven-segment display, showcasing FPGA-based design efficiency.
